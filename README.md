# meta-ads-cli

Create and manage Meta (Facebook/Instagram) ad campaigns from your terminal.

> Built by [Attainment Labs](https://attainment.co)

## Why

Meta Ads Manager is slow. Clicking through 15 screens to launch a campaign is a waste of time when you already know what you want to run.

This tool lets you define a campaign in a YAML file and deploy it with one command.

```
meta-ads create --config campaign.yaml
```

One campaign. One ad set. Multiple ads. All created in seconds.

## Install

```bash
pip install meta-ads-cli
```

Or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/attainmentlabs/meta-ads-cli.git
cd meta-ads-cli
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

**1. Set up your credentials**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Meta access token, ad account ID, and page ID
```

**2. Create your campaign config**

```bash
cp campaign.example.yaml campaign.yaml
# Edit campaign.yaml with your ad copy, images, targeting, and budget
```

**3. Validate your config**

```bash
meta-ads validate --config campaign.yaml
```

**4. Preview with dry run**

```bash
meta-ads create --config campaign.yaml --dry-run
```

**5. Deploy**

```bash
meta-ads create --config campaign.yaml
```

Your campaign is created as PAUSED by default. Review it in Ads Manager, then activate it when ready.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root (or export these in your shell):

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `META_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Yes | Your Meta API access token |
| `META_AD_ACCOUNT_ID` | Yes | Your ad account ID (numbers only, no `act_` prefix) |
| `META_PAGE_ID` | Yes | Your Facebook Page ID |
| `META_API_VERSION` | No | API version (default: `v21.0`) |

### Campaign Config (YAML)

Your campaign is defined in a single YAML file. Here is the full schema:

```yaml
campaign:
  name: "My Campaign"
  objective: OUTCOME_TRAFFIC        # See objectives below
  status: PAUSED                    # PAUSED or ACTIVE
  special_ad_categories: []         # Leave empty unless required

ad_set:
  name: "My Ad Set"
  daily_budget: 1000                # In cents. 1000 = $10/day
  optimization_goal: LINK_CLICKS    # See optimization goals below
  targeting:
    age_min: 18
    age_max: 65
    genders: [0]                    # 0 = all, 1 = male, 2 = female
    countries: ["US"]
    interests:                      # Optional
      - id: "6003139266461"
        name: "Fitness and wellness"
    platforms: ["facebook", "instagram"]
    facebook_positions: ["feed"]
    instagram_positions: ["stream", "story", "reels"]

ads:
  - name: "My Ad"
    image: ./images/ad.png          # Path relative to YAML file
    primary_text: "Your ad copy."
    headline: "Your Headline"
    description: "Short description"
    cta: LEARN_MORE                 # See CTAs below
    link: "https://example.com"
```

**Campaign Objectives:** `OUTCOME_TRAFFIC`, `OUTCOME_AWARENESS`, `OUTCOME_ENGAGEMENT`, `OUTCOME_LEADS`, `OUTCOME_SALES`, `OUTCOME_APP_PROMOTION`

**Optimization Goals:** `LINK_CLICKS`, `IMPRESSIONS`, `REACH`, `LANDING_PAGE_VIEWS`, `APP_INSTALLS`, `OFFSITE_CONVERSIONS`, `LEAD_GENERATION`

**CTA Options:** `LEARN_MORE`, `SIGN_UP`, `DOWNLOAD`, `SHOP_NOW`, `BOOK_NOW`, `GET_OFFER`, `SUBSCRIBE`, `CONTACT_US`, `APPLY_NOW`, `WATCH_MORE`

## Getting a Meta Access Token

This is the part most people get stuck on. Here is the short version:

1. Go to [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) and create an app (type: Business)
2. Open the [Graph API Explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/)
3. Select your app, then request these permissions: `ads_management`, `pages_read_engagement`, `pages_show_list`
4. Click "Generate Access Token" and authorize
5. Copy the token to your `.env` file

**Important:** Graph API Explorer tokens expire after about 2 hours. For production use, exchange it for a long-lived token:

```bash
curl "https://graph.facebook.com/v21.0/oauth/access_token?\
grant_type=fb_exchange_token&\
client_id=YOUR_APP_ID&\
client_secret=YOUR_APP_SECRET&\
fb_exchange_token=YOUR_SHORT_LIVED_TOKEN"
```

Long-lived tokens last about 60 days.

## Finding Interest IDs

Interest targeting requires Meta's internal IDs. Search for them using the API:

```bash
curl "https://graph.facebook.com/v21.0/search?\
type=adinterest&\
q=fitness&\
access_token=YOUR_TOKEN"
```

This returns interest names and IDs you can use in your campaign YAML.

## Examples

See the [`examples/`](examples/) directory for ready-to-customize campaign configs:

- **[ecommerce.yaml](examples/ecommerce.yaml)**: Product launch targeting skincare enthusiasts
- **[app-install.yaml](examples/app-install.yaml)**: Mobile app install campaign for fitness users

## How It Works

This tool wraps the [Meta Marketing API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-apis/) with `requests`. No heavy SDKs. The full chain:

1. Uploads your ad images to your ad account
2. Creates a campaign with your objective
3. Creates an ad set with your budget and targeting
4. Creates ad creatives linking your images and copy
5. Creates ads linking creatives to the ad set

Everything is created as `PAUSED` by default so you can review before spending.
